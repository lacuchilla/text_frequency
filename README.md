This is a Ruby project that takes in a set of documents and a list of words, and searches for the text frequency of those words in each of the files. Text frequency is calculated by dividing the number of instances of a particular word in a file by the total number of words in the file.

This was built using Ruby version 2.3

You must download this project and use it in the same directory where the text files you want to check are located.

To run this project, in the terminal, navigate to the directory where the text files and this project are located on your computer and type: ruby word_frequency.rb, then the names of the text files you want to search and the words you want to search for as strings, i.e "textfile.txt" "word" "to" "search"

It will return the name of the file, then the text frequency for each word searched in the file, for every file the user passes as an argument.
